# Basic-template for Infyom

The point of this is to provide a basic-template for the Infyom Laravel-Generator. There a dozens of "Admin Panel" generators available for Laravel each one more feature-rich and flashy than the last. I wanted the ability to do basic scaffolding of data, particularly using a database-first approach that didn't provide a fancy Admin Panel. My experience with MVC frameworks from Phalcon, Symfony and ASP MVC was such that in the early stages most frameworks provided an ability to scaffold up CRUD from Model classes or often from a pre-existing Database. This approach is helpful when teaching students about MVC frameworks (as I do). Often students will have learnt basic coding, some relational databases and some Server Side Web Development. A good entry point into Web App Frameworks is to show easy and useful it is to Scaffold up CRUD from a pre-existing database. It's a quick win and they see the benefits quickly. The Admin Panel on the other hand, from a teaching perspective is overkill. Admin panels also tend to be dependent on User Login and Security which they also wouldn't be familiar with in the early stages.

This template is an adaptation of the AdminLTE panel that the Infyom Laravel-Geneator defaults to. It replaces the app.blade.php in the layouts folder with a super simple easy to under stand Bootstrap 5.0 base page
